*Iris Flower Classification*

This project uses the classic Iris dataset to predict the species of an iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on petal and sepal measurements. It’s a great beginner-friendly classification project and often called the “Hello World” of machine learning.

*Tech Stack*
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Gradio (for the web interface)

*Features*
1. Predicts iris species from four numeric features.
2. Simple web interface for easy testing.
3. Clean, beginner-friendly code.

*How to Run*
1. Clone the repo and install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run the app (`python app.py` or your main script).
3. Open the provided local URL to interact with the app.
